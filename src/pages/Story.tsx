              <p>
                In the winter of 2021, while serving as a new patrol officer, I was dispatched to what was supposed to be a routine family disturbance. A young man was struggling to manage his situation, and my partner and I were focused on preventing it from escalating into an arrest.
              </p>

              <p>
                After nearly half an hour of conversation, it became painfully clear that he had nowhere to turn. No guardians, no family to stay with, no friends to call. When I suggested cooling off at the local YMCA, he explained that it wasn't an option, he didn't have a membership.
              </p>

              <p>
                That moment has stayed with me. Growing up, I always had resourcesâ€”family, friends, mentors, and even a gym where I could escape when life felt heavy. This young man had none of those. I felt as though I had failed him because I couldn't provide a safe place. His only options were to risk going back inside, where the situation could lead to his arrest, or to turn to the streets.
              </p>

              <p>
                Not long after, I learned he had tragically lost his life to gun violence.
              </p>

              <p>
                That experience changed me. It showed me that if we truly want to keep young men and women off the streets, we must create outlets, healthy, safe spaces where they can go when life feels overwhelming. I couldn't give someone more family or friends, but I could help provide an outlet. For me, and for many others, that outlet is the gym.
              </p>

              <p>
                With the support of friends, family, and the community, I launched a fundraiser to provide gym memberships for young adults in need. The response was overwhelming. In just two years, we provided over 540 months of gym access, 540 months of growth, safety, and belonging. Inspired by this impact, we knew it was time to build something bigger.
              </p>

              <p>
                That's why Strength Over Struggle was born.
              </p>

              <p>
                We exist to give youth and young adults the safe spaces and positive resources they may not otherwise have. A gym membership may seem small, but to someone without options, it can mean everything: a place to go, a place to grow, and even a chance to change the course of their future.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is our mission. This is our why.
